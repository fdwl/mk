firmware descriptions:

important note: folders with a "-old" in the name are intended for use with old 40h grids, which require a rotated orientation when tiling multiple grids together. the code performs this rotation. do not use the "-old" firmwares with new mk grids.

default > the normal, most basic firmware. no auxiliary function.
encoders > includes support for 8 encoders, hooked up to the aux port. see docs for hookup.
tilt > support for tilt sensor. implemented, but waiting for serialosc support. coming very soon.
